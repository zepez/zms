# Z Media Server (zms)

## Packages

- *packages/common* shared utility functions.
- *packages/config-server* validates and provides type-safe interface for environment variables. This can only ever be used on the server to avoid leaking sensitive data.
- *packages/constant* contains values that are re-used multiple times, but do not change often and can not be environment variables.
- *packages/db* contains database schema and client management.
- *packages/transcode* video transcoding logic using `ffmpeg`.
- *packages/web* is the Next.js server.
